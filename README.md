| Platform | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🪟 Windows | `.exe` | Double-click to install |
| 🍎 macOS | `.dmg` Comming soon! | Drag to Applications |
| 🐧 Linux | `.AppImage` or `.deb` | Works on most distros, see below |

## 🐧 Linux Users

You can run the `.AppImage` directly or install via:

```
sudo apt install ./encrypted-todo-app.deb // change suggested by ChadSec from dpkg to apt
```

Or mark the `.AppImage` as executable and run it:

```
chmod +x Encrypted-ToDo.AppImage
./Encrypted-ToDo.AppImage
```

## 🧠 How it Works

*   Runs entirely locally using an encrypted SQLite database.
*   All tasks are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a SHA-256 derived key.
*   You can define logic rules directly in the UI to customize behavior.
*   No internet connection is needed; no data is ever sent online.
